1.05	17 September 2002
	Found that there is a better way to set signals on p5p (thanks Tels!),
	using POSIX's sigaction().  Instead of just setting %SIG, we now use
	sigaction().  Added internal methods _set and _ignore to aid in this.
	This should allow signals to come through in threads::shared::cond_wait
	and system calls such as "gethostbyaddr".

	Fixed some documentation nits.

1.04	9 September 2002
	Added some internal stuff so that Thread::Status can do its job more
	easily.

	6 September 2002
	Fixed problem with redefine warnings when running with -w.

1.03	6 September 2002
	Added special meaning "-2" to signify all threads that have signal
	activated _except_ the current thread.

	Added class methods "tids" and "othertids" for returning the thread
	ID's that have a specific signal activated.

1.02	4 September 2002
	Found the trick for automatically registering signals.  Completely
	reworked the inside to allow automatic registration.  Added methods
	"automatic" and "unautomatic" and added some more tests.

	3 September 2002
	Removed : unique attribute from VERSION: this doesn't work with
	AutoLoader apparently (still need to verify that, though)

	Fixed some documentation nits.

1.01	2 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Signal.  Starts with version 1.01 to prevent
	problems with old 5.005 threads Thread::Signal on CPAN.
