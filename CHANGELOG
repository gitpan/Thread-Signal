1.11	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

1.10	3 November 2003
	Apparently newer Linux systems don't have pid's for threads anymore
	either.  Added compile time check for this behaviour: nown fails to
	compile if it doesn't work.  Adapted test-suite accordingly.

1.09	23 August 2003
	Version 1.08 somewhore fell into a black hole because of the problems
	that PAUSE had the past days.  Upping the version number seemed to be
	the only way to fix this.

1.08	21 August 2003
	Fixed problem with undefined string in split whenever used from
	another module at compile time.  This particularly occurred when
	doing a perl -wc on a script.  Also fixed a type on _allowed: now
	how did that ever get by use strict?

	Fixed some internal documentation.

	Removed references to "AutoLoader" from the documentation: the
	infamous "load" module is now used.

1.07	12 August 2003
	Adapted test-suite to better check and notify user when Thread::Signal
	will not work on the platform.  Cleaned up Makefile.PL and adapted
	copyright notice.

	Added "SYSTEMS IT DOESN'T WORK ON" section to the pod.

	Still wasn't able to silence strange warnings in the test-suite ;-(.
	Added message that this shouldn't happen in real world situations,
	or else!  ;-)  

1.06    30 September 2002
        Use "load.pm" instead of AutoLoader.  Added dependency on load.pm
	in Makefile.PL.

	Removed "our" from $VERSION, should shave off some bytes in
	memory usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

1.05	17 September 2002
	Found that there is a better way to set signals on p5p (thanks Tels!),
	using POSIX's sigaction().  Instead of just setting %SIG, we now use
	sigaction().  Added internal methods _set and _ignore to aid in this.
	This should allow signals to come through in threads::shared::cond_wait
	and system calls such as "gethostbyaddr".

	Fixed some documentation nits.

1.04	9 September 2002
	Added some internal stuff so that Thread::Status can do its job more
	easily.

	6 September 2002
	Fixed problem with redefine warnings when running with -w.

1.03	6 September 2002
	Added special meaning "-2" to signify all threads that have signal
	activated _except_ the current thread.

	Added class methods "tids" and "othertids" for returning the thread
	ID's that have a specific signal activated.

1.02	4 September 2002
	Found the trick for automatically registering signals.  Completely
	reworked the inside to allow automatic registration.  Added methods
	"automatic" and "unautomatic" and added some more tests.

	3 September 2002
	Removed : unique attribute from VERSION: this doesn't work with
	AutoLoader apparently (still need to verify that, though)

	Fixed some documentation nits.

1.01	2 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Signal.  Starts with version 1.01 to prevent
	problems with old 5.005 threads Thread::Signal on CPAN.
