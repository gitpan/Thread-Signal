1.02	4 September 2002
	Found the trick for automatically registering signals.  Completely
	reworked the inside to allow automatic registration.  Added methods
	"automatic" and "unautomatic" and added some more tests.

	3 September 2002
	Removed : unique attribute from VERSION: this doesn't work with
	AutoLoader apparently (still need to verify that, though)

	Fixed some documentation nits.

1.01	2 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Signal.  Starts with version 1.01 to prevent
	problems with old 5.005 threads Thread::Signal on CPAN.
